# Bakkesmod

Bakkesmod is a third party mod with a lot of fun features. We at RLIS use it in our production to make better content. You can use it to help with your training, or to locally host a match with your friends on a custom map. You can even change your decal on your car to be custom designed, but for that you need to also install the `BakkesMod` plugin `AlphaConsole`.

*As mentioned before it is a third party program not created by Psyonix/Epic. Install it at your own risk.*
